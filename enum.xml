                                            &lt;p&gt;There are approximately a dozen members of&amp;nbsp;the cathepsin&amp;nbsp;family, which are distinguished by their structure, catalytic mechanism, and which proteins they cleave. Most of the members become activated at the low pH found in lysosomes. Thus, the activity of this family lies almost entirely within those organelles. Cathepsins have been implicated in several diseases, including cancer, stroke, Alzheimer's disease, arthritis,&amp;nbsp;COPD, chronic periodontitis, and several ocular disorders (keratoconus, retinal detachment, age-related macular degeneration, and glaucoma).&lt;br&gt;&#xD;

The Seven C's of Web Content Management&#xD;
Expand your WCM Strategy Beyond Just Managing Content&#xD;
&#xD;
Written by Stephen Powers, Principal Analyst&#xD;
Forrester Research, Inc. - February 2, 2011&#xD;
&#xD;
The web content management (WCM) market is currently experiencing a significant evolution as &#xD;
requirements for those platforms have grown beyond just managing web content. Instead, &#xD;
organizations need WCM to help support rich, contextual, engaging, cross-channel experiences. &#xD;
The growth of new content types, the emergence of new channels, and the increased expectations &#xD;
of customers all drive this significant change in WCM. &#xD;

Expand your WCM Strategy Beyond Just Managing Content&#xD;

organizations need WCM to help support rich, contextual, engaging, cross-channel experiences. &#xD;
The growth of new content types, the emergence of new channels, and the increased expectations &#xD;
of customers all drive this significant change in WCM. &#xD;

of customers all drive this significant change in WCM. &#xD;
